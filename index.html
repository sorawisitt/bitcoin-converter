## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project is a high-performance financial tool designed for the Thai Bitcoin community. It bridges the gap between traditional fiat (THB) and the Bitcoin network's native units (BTC & Satoshis). Built with a focus on Purchasing Power Parity, it allows users to visualize their Bitcoin holdings against everyday Thai expenses and custom life goals.

## ✨ Engineering Features

### 📊 Real-Time Financial Dashboard

- **Live Node Sync:** Fetches real-time market rates from Bitkub and network congestion data (fees) from Mempool.space.
- **Halving Countdown:** A precision timer tracking the next Bitcoin block reward subsidy halving.
- **Network Fee Insight:** Displays "Priority Next Block" fees in sats/vB to help users optimize transaction costs.

### 🧮 Smart Multi-Way Converter

- **Bidirectional Logic:** Update any field (THB, SAT, or BTC), and the remaining two synchronize instantly using a reactive state engine.
- **Hard Cap Protection:** Implements a strict validation rule for the 21,000,000 BTC total supply limit, including a UI warning system.
- **Human-Friendly Formatting:** Automatically handles commas and decimal precision (up to 8 places for BTC) while maintaining a clean "Copy to Clipboard" utility.

### 🏠 The "Bitcoin Standard" Comparison

- **Asset Benchmarking:** Compares Satoshi values against items like Street Food (🍜), Gold (📀), and Real Estate (🚗).
- **Custom Savings Goals:** Users can add, save, and delete personal financial targets (e.g., "Dream House"). Data is persisted via localStorage for privacy-first, server-less state management.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology | Implementation Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logic | Vanilla JavaScript | Asynchronous API handling with fetch and custom number formatting logic. |
| Styling | CSS Variables | Dynamic theme engine (Light/Dark/System) and Glassmorphism effects. |
| APIs | RESTful Integration | Multi-endpoint synchronization with 30-second auto-refresh cycles. |
| Assets | Performance-Optimized | WebP icons and system-font stacks for sub-100ms rendering. |

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The UI is built on Glassmorphism principles:

- **Visual Depth:** Uses `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` and radial gradients to create a sense of layering.
- **Responsive Architecture:** A mobile-first grid system that scales from iPhone displays to ultra-wide monitors.
- **Accessibility:** High-contrast typography using the Inter and JetBrains Mono font families for maximum readability of financial figures.
